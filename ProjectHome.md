This plugin was created out of the need to have a plugin for winamp to play Sega Megadrive (Genesis) YM music logs.  (So that rather than having to load an emulator, and fiddle around with music test screens to listen to the music, you could just drag a file onto winamp and listen to it)

This plugin is getting a little old now, and it's not been updated for a few years, but some still like it's sound, so I've decided to release the source...

I dont know if I've got the license right, I'm not a laywer...
